# -Sonar-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction
Utilizing logistic regression, this Python code analyzes sonar data to distinguish between rocks (R) and mines (M). The model achieves an accuracy of 83.4% on training data. It includes dataset exploration, preprocessing, model training, and a predictive system for new instances.
Data Exploration:

The dataset contains 208 samples with 60 features each.
Descriptive statistics and value counts provide insights.
Data Preprocessing:

Separate features (x) and labels (y).
Convert labels ('R' and 'M') to binary values.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Logistic regression model is trained using the training set.
Achieves an 83.4% accuracy on training data.
Predictive System:

Input new sonar data for prediction.
Model classifies instances as 'Rock' (R) or 'Mine' (M).
Conclusion:

Logistic regression effectively distinguishes between rocks and mines.
The code provides a practical example of classification in sonar data analysis.
